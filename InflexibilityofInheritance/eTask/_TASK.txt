Imagine a month passes and the Simulation Duck Software is working fine.
The customer asks for a change to the fly() method 
	- add a println("wheesh"); to show the flying sound-effect to Ducks.
	
	Try to do this - what does it involve?


TASK Part:
(Study pages 9 - 14 of the Head-First Design Patterns)

ANSWER:

Involves adding a print statement to every flyable duck class, very inefficient if situation was on a bigger scale
